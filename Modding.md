### FX ENGINE MODDING DOCUMENTATION

* FX Engine uses Psych Engine's modding backend for mods but there are some limitations.

* Events don't exist, lua isn't supported (fucking hell to implement), You **MAY** need a characterList.txt file.

# How to run mods

* Download any Psych Engine mod from 0.6.3 and below (7.x mods aren't supported.).

* Extract into the mods folder

* Press 7 to go into the Extras Menu, and go on Mods Selection and activate the mod that you downloaded!

# How to port Psych Engine Mods to FX Engine

* Most of the stuff is already handled by the engine itself, the only thing you may need to fix is offsets.

# How to create mods with FX Engine

* Same way as psych but without lua and events lol
